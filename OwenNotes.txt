8 Channels for schematic
work out how to do channels with respect to ground

Asked Professor which area would be good to observe next,
he suggested visual or auditory cortex (probably primary)
as it can be easily observed with respect to something like
a pulse train of light or a tone. Visual is probably easier
to locate. Hopefully the animal sciences people won't take
issue :)

Did a basic copy and paste of the amplifier setup. Trying
to understand how a homebrew EEG is made.

It seems the youtube channel "Bruce Land" is a Cornell ECE
prof who teaches an embedded/DSP/controls class. He posts
videos of project demos for his class. The videos have 
links to project pages in the descriptions. Some are EEG
projects.
There's also a blog for some guy named Chip Stein. 
He did some EEG and other neuro stuff, but his writing is
a bit sparse. Includes diagrams though.
The current iteration uses the TL084 Op-amp.

--- Datasheet is in folder now.

Found notes for KiCAD, they actually seem readable
https://docs.kicad.org/
Making heirarchical structure for schematic because
Op-amp setup will repeat. Using tl081 op-amp instead
of tl084 so each can be individual in heirarchical 
sheet. Could be reconfigured to make sub-sheets with
tl084. Heirarchical sheets need to be completed.
