Asked Professor which area would be good to observe next,
he suggested visual or auditory cortex (probably primary)
as it can be easily observed with respect to something like
a pulse train of light or a tone. Visual is probably easier
to locate. Hopefully the animal sciences people won't take
issue :)

Did a basic copy and paste of the amplifier setup. Trying
to understand how a homebrew EEG is made.

It seems the youtube channel "Bruce Land" is a Cornell ECE
prof who teaches an embedded/DSP/controls class. He posts
videos of project demos for his class. The videos have 
links to project pages in the descriptions. Some are EEG
projects.
There's also a blog for some guy named Chip Stein. 
He did some EEG and other neuro stuff, but his writing is
a bit sparse. Includes diagrams though.
The current iteration uses the TL084 Op-amp.
